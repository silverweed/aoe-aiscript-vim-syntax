Vim Syntax highlighting for Age Of Empires II AI Personality scripts


Description
=======================
This is a very basic suite of Vim syntax files which highlights syntax
in AOE2 AI personality scripts (with extension .per). 

Many things are missing, like the predefined constant values and so on, but
it's better than nothing.

Install
=======================
<ul>
  <li>On \*nix: put these two files in the proper directories ~/.vim/{syntax,ftdetect}</li>
  <li>On Windows: dunno, never used Vim on Windows...search on the vim wiki :P</li>
</ul>
